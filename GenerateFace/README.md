# Generate Faces with DCGAN
In this project, we build a model to generate faces using DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network). The model learns the distribution of faces from the celebrity images, and it generates whole new set of face images which look like a real celebrity!

## Steps
1. Build a Discriminator - takes an image and output a single value that indicates whether a given image is real or fake
2. Build a Generator - take a vector and output an image
3. Define a Generator Loss - 
4. Define a Discriminator Loss - 
5. Train the network
6. Generate pictures

## Training

## Result
The faces generated by DCGAN looks like below.
