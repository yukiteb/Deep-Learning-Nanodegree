# Generate Faces with DCGAN
In this project, we build a model to generate faces using DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network). The model learns the distribution of faces from the celebrity images, and it generates whole new set of face images which look like a real celebrity!

## Data
The training data come from [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). Below are the examples of training data.

## Project Steps
1. Build a Discriminator - a discriminator takes an image and outputs a single value that indicates whether a given image is real or fake.
2. Build a Generator - a generator takes a vector and outputs an image.
3. Define a Discriminator/Generator Loss - Discriminator loss is minimized when it correctly discrminates whether the image is real or fake. Generator loss is exactly opposite of discriminator, when it successfully fools the discriminator to think that the generated image is a real one.
4. Train the network
5. Generate pictures

## Model

Below is the structure of Discriminator and Generator.

### Discriminator

- takes 32x32 image tensor
- there are 3 convolutional layers, followed by a FC layer
- leaky ReLu is applied as an activiation function and dropout regularization is used after every convolutional layer.

### Generator

- takes 100 dimensional vector
- there is FC layer, followed by 3 transpose convolutional layers
- ReLu is applied as an activation function, except for the last transpose convolutional layer which uses tanh.
- dropout regularization is used after every layer.

## Result
The faces generated by DCGAN looks like below.
