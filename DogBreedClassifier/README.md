# Classifying Dog Breed with CNN
In this project, we build a dog-breed classifier using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). First, we. Finally, we build an app (function) which tells whether a given picture of whether it is a human, a dog, or something else. If the app identifies picture as a dog then it tells you the breed, but if the picture is human, it tells you the most resembling breed of dogs.

## Project Steps
1. Build a human face-detector using OpenCV.
2. Build a dog detector using pre-trained VGG-16. It is trained on ImageNet and 1000 categories.
3. Build a dog breed classifier from scratch.
4. Build a dog breed classifier using transfer learning with VGG-16.
5. Combine the above to create an app. Given a picture, the app tells 1) if it is
