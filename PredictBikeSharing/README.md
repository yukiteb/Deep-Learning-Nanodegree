# Predict Bike-Sharing Pattern
In this project, we build a simple neural network from scratch using numpy to predict bike-sharing pattern.

## Data
The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. Below is a plot showing the number of bike riders over the first 10 days or so in the data set.

## Project Steps
1. Read and preprocess the data
2. Build a network with a single hidden layer - 
3. Train the network - use SGD for 10,000 iterations
