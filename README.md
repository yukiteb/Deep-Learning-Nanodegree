# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree

This repo contains the projects for the purpose of Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. There are 5 projects:

1. [Predicting Bike-Sharing Pattern](/PredictBikeSharing/README.md) - In this project, a simgple neural network is built with numpy to predict the bike-sharing patter.

2. [Classifying Dog Breed with CNN](/DogBreedClassifier/README.md) - In this project, we build a dog-breed classifier using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). First, we. Finally, we build an app (function) which tells whether a given picture of whether it is a human, a dog, or something else. If the app identifies the breed of dog, but if the picture is human, it tells you the most resembling breed of dogs.

3. [Generate TV Scripts with RNN](/GenerateTVScript/README.md) - In this project, 

4. [Generate Faces with DCGAN](/GenerateFace/README.md) - In this project, 

5. [Deploying Sentiment Analysis Model on SageMaker](/SageMakerDeployment/README.md) - In this project,
