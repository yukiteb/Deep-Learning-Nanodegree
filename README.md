# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree

This repo contains the projects for the purpose of Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. There are 5 projects:

1. [Predicting Bike-Sharing Pattern](/PredictBikeSharing/README.md) - In this project, a simgple neural network is built with numpy to predict the bike-sharing patter.

2. Classifying Dog Breed with CNN

3. Generate TV Scripts with RNN

4. Generate Faces with DCGAN

5. Deploying Sentiment Analysis Model on SageMaker
