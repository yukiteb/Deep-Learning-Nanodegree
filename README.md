# Deep-Learning-Nanodegree

This repo contains the projects for the purpose of Deep Learning Nanodegree from Udacity. There are 5 projects:

1. [Predicting Bike-Sharing Pattern](/PredictBikeSharing/README.md) - In this project, a simgple neural network is built with numpy to predict the predict daily bike rental ridership.

2. [Classifying Dog Breed with CNN](/DogBreedClassifier/README.md) - In this project, we build a dog-breed classifier using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). First, we. Finally, we build an app (function) which tells whether a given picture of whether it is a human, a dog, or something else. If the app identifies the breed of dog, but if the picture is human, it tells you the most resembling breed of dogs.

3. [Generate TV Scripts with RNN](/GenerateTVScript/README.md) - In this project, we generate Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. The model learns from [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) and generates fake TV script.

4. [Generate Faces with DCGAN](/GenerateFace/README.md) - In this project, we build a model to generate faces using DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network). The model learns the distribution of faces from the celebrity images, and it generates whole new set of face images which look like a real celebrity!

5. [Deploying Sentiment Analysis Model on SageMaker](/SageMakerDeployment/README.md) - In this project, we demonstrate how we can delopy sentiment analysis model on AWS SageMaker. A simple LSTM based model is used for the sentiment analysis. Together with Lambda function and API gateway,
